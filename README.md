# What is the impact of public spending on the number of deaths in Brazilian cities?

This project aims to understand how certain economic variables impact the number of deaths in Brazilian cities. To achieve this, a cross-section of municipalities is used, containing the dependent variable, the number of deaths, and potential explanatory variables, such as municipal budget expenditures, total population, geographic region, and educational indicators. This study was inspired by the article [*US mortality by economic, demographic, and social characteristics: the National Longitudinal Mortality Study*](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/epdf/10.2105/AJPH.85.7.949) by Sorlie, Backlund and Keller, published in the *American Journal of Public Health* in 1995.

_The project was developed within the scope of the Econometrics I course taught in the 1st semester of 2022 at FEA-USP. As a result, the repository also contains some exercises completed during the course._
